### This is a group of Python Programs that I worked on after my time at Coding Dojo.

## The first one I finished was the maze path finder
  #  Its pretty cool it goes through and checks the value of the neighbor of the spot you are on and moves to the nearest one, all while holding on to the path it took.


# here showing the maze where the # are blocked spots and the open spots are where the path can move. It starts at "O" and ends at "X".
